            <h2>Design and Implementation of Parallax Effect</h2>
            <h4> Write a brief report on the design and implementation of your parallax effect, the challenges you faced, and how you overcame them.</h4>
            <p>The first challenge I had when it came to the Parallax Effect assignment, is to think of a concept in which I would utilize the parallax effect. I would say that I think in more of an analytical approach rather than a creative approach. </p>
            <p>Another challenged I faced was that I do not have the tools, or Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop in order to take an image and create different layers of the image to create a mask to create depth. I downloaded the free tool GIMP and tried to create an inverted layer copy of the clouds and sky. However, I am not sure it worked. </p>
            <p>When I was unsure if the parallax effect would work after so many days of contemplating and trying several other concepts and images, trying to create layers for depth. I finally came up with the concept of using the sky and clouds. Probably because my name actually means clouds in my culture. </p>
            <p>I think I thought that using the white text incorporated with white clouds would give it some depth. In terms of interactivity, The only thing I could think to use was an airplane or a UFO, but that can probably be used for another concept. </p>
